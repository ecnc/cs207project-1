"""
 Purpose: to generate (using tsmaker) a set of 1000 time series, each stored in a file
 Function expects input of n which is the number of timeseries to be generated, with the default of 1000.
 Output is n timeseries saved in the format of 'ts_1.npy' ... to 'ts_1000.npy' in the current working directory
